## What I've Created
- `spectra_app_1.html` - Complete redesigned UI for spectroscopic data app
- `scientific_theme.css` - Professional dark theme optimized for scientific work
- Modern, clean layout with collapsible sidebar and organized controls

## Your Mission
Integrate this new UI design into the user's existing spectroscopic data application without breaking existing functionality.

## Key Files to Use
1. **spectra_app_1.html** - Reference for new HTML structure
2. **scientific_theme.css** - Theme variables and styling
3. User's existing codebase (Python/JS backend + current frontend)

## Integration Strategy (SAFE APPROACH)
1. **Phase 1**: Add theme CSS to existing app, test nothing breaks
2. **Phase 2**: Gradually replace HTML sections (header → sidebar → main content)
3. **Phase 3**: Preserve all existing JavaScript/Python functionality
4. **Phase 4**: Test thoroughly at each step

## Critical Requirements
- ✅ Keep ALL existing functionality working
- ✅ Maintain existing API endpoints/data connections
- ✅ Preserve plot/visualization capabilities
- ✅ Don't break form submissions or data processing
- ✅ Test incrementally, don't change everything at once

## What NOT to Change
- Backend Python code
- Data processing logic
- API endpoints
- Core JavaScript functionality
- Database connections

## What TO Change
- HTML structure (gradually)
- CSS styling (use my theme)
- UI layout and organization
- Visual design and colors

## Success Criteria
- User gets the clean, modern UI I designed
- All existing features still work perfectly
- No data loss or functionality breaks
- Smooth, professional user experience

Good luck! The user wants their cluttered interface to have "a nice face" - my design provides exactly that.
