# Change Record

- Date: 2025-12-16
- Owner: Copilot
- CAP(s): CAP-14, CAP-12
- Summary: Implemented an in-app Docs hub backed by repo-local markdown + added the minimum agent handoff pack docs.

## Why

CAP-14 requires docs to be a first-class, offline-friendly feature with search + navigation, and CAP-12 requires changes to be discoverable and verifiable.

## What changed

- Added a Docs hub UI with:
  - left navigation (categories + pages)
  - search across titles + content
  - markdown content viewer for repo-local docs
- Added a minimal contextual "Learn more" link on import preview errors (Library page) that deep-links into the Docs hub.
- Added the initial Agent Handoff Pack files in `docs/` and a small glossary/reference hub.

## Wiring notes (UI -> logic)

- UI: Docs page (`/docs`) -> viewer renders markdown loaded from repo `docs/` files.
- UI: Library page error banner -> link to `/docs?doc=cap-01&q=messy%20csv`.

## Verification

- `scripts/verify.ps1`: PASS
- Manual smoke (if relevant): Open `/docs`, search for "FITS" or "A/B", select a CAP page.

## Follow-ups

- Add short, user-facing doc pages (Diátaxis) instead of relying on full CAP specs for end-user help.
- Add more contextual "Learn more" links (and/or anchors) as workflows stabilize.
