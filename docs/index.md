# Spectra App Docs

This folder contains the in-repo documentation used by the in-app Docs hub (CAP-14).

## Start here

- If you’re a contributor/agent: see `docs/README_FOR_AGENTS.md`.
- If you’re implementing features: start from the CAP specs in `docs/CAPS/`.
- If you’re changing UI navigation or core screens: keep `docs/ui_contract.json` up to date.

## Docs model (Diátaxis)

We aim to keep docs short and task-oriented:

- Tutorials: learning-by-doing
- How-to: steps to accomplish a task
- Reference: definitions, schemas, formats
- Explanation: design rationale and constraints
